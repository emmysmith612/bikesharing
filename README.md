# NYC-Citibike Challenge
Module 15 Challenge 

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to provide information on the necessity of starting a Citibike program in Des Moines, Iowa. Using data pulled from New york Citibike, different visualizations were created in an effort to convince investors to invest in this venture.Throughout this challenge we were able to answer various questions to assist with investor on making a decision.

## Results
Using Tableau multiple visualizations were created based on NYC Citibike program with the focus being on the month of August. August was chosen because it falls into summer which is the most active time for being outdoor and traveling. The visuals to the results can be found here https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/emily.smith5951/viz/CitibikeNYC_16747919714350/CitibikeNYC?publish=yes
  


## Summary 
Overall Citibike has proven to be extremely essential for travel in New York. Based off the data, use of Citibike is an important part of travel during rush hour, with a wide net of start/end times scattered throughout the city. Itâ€™s a fair observation to say a service like this would most likely be popular in another major city like Des Moines. Overall there is a consistent demand for bike rentals which in return provides a steady profit for investors.
